%Abstract
\Large\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\break
With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, ribosome profiling is coming of
age. Previously, assembly and analysis of this data was hindered by the need to
manually assemble raw data for several samples with options from a variety of
assemblers, followed by data structure formatting and quality control, and
general and targeted analysis. As ribosome profiling is still a maturing
technique, a standard set of protocols both at the bench and in silico are yet
to be widely adopted. In an effort to standardize the in silico portion of
ribosome profiling and improve accessibility of the computational aspects of
this sequencing technology for the general public, we developed “RiboPipe,” a
flexible, automated pipeline optimized for rapid assembly of raw single-end,
short (<100nt) sequence data and quality analysis of libraries.

%Background
\Large\textbf{BACKGROUND}
\break
Ribosome profiling is an emerging and developing technology that takes advantage
of the recent developments in high-throughput sequencing to measure protein
translation dynamics in cells in different genetic backgrounds, during time
courses, etc. These metrics are obtained by sequencing both the ribosome
footprint, or the RNA protected by the ribosome and accepted as an output of
what the cell was translating at the time of harvest, and total mRNA. Briefly,
to perform ribosome profiling, cultures are grown in the appropriate conditions,
harvested, and flash frozen, then lysed for downstream RNA isolation. The next
step is to isolate the ribosome footprints by performing an RNase-mediated
digestion of RNA and preserving the mRNA footprint protected by the ribosome as
the ribosome complex is somewhat impervious to RNase digestion. Footprint RNAs
are then separated from ribosomal RNAs by a variety of methods (see references
for examples), rRNA depleted via targeted probes or other rRNA-depletion kits
(RiboZero, etc) and integrated into an Illumina sequencing library. With a total
RNA aliquot from each sample, RNA is similarly rRNA-depleted by a kit-based
method, fragmented to produce a similarly-sized library to the ribosome
footprints, and integrated into an Illumina sequencing library.
