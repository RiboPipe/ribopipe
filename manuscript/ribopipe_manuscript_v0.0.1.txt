With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, ribosome profiling is coming of
age. Previously, assembly and analysis of this data was hindered by the need to
manually assemble raw data for several samples with options from a variety of
assemblers, followed by data structure formatting and quality control, and
general and targeted analysis. As ribosome profiling is still a maturing
technique, a standard set of protocols both at the bench and in silico are yet
to be widely adopted. In an effort to standardize the in silico portion of
ribosome profiling and improve accessibility of the computational aspects of
this sequencing technology for the general public, we developed “RiboPipe,” a
flexible, automated pipeline optimized for rapid assembly of raw single-end,
short (<100nt) sequence data and quality analysis of libraries.
